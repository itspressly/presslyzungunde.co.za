      <p>Hi my name is pressly and this is my portfolio. I have listed information about myself, you can go through it and tell me what you think. It took a while learning how to code but I'm starting to get the hang of it. So please when viewing my work please don't be too judgy.(lol) I  love working with computers and Im guessing that's where my passion came from. Ever since I learnt how to code I am always on my laptop ethier making robots, games and websites I will never forget how confused I was when it was my first time working on a project.</p>

And this was in grade 5, My primary school was very fun and very bad to attend I always made sure to do my homework but I never really liked school and the fact we had to study as most kids in my schol, I only started being serious when i thought of how hard it is to get a job in south africa and most importantly <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=poverty&oq=poverty&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiLAxiABDIKCAIQABiLAxiABDIKCAMQABiLAxiABDINCAQQABiLAxixAxiABDIKCAUQABiLAxiABDIKCAYQABiLAxiABDIKCAcQABiLAxiABDIKCAgQABiLAxiABDIKCAkQABiLAxiABNIBDTcyODExMjYzajFqMTWoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">poverty </a> is strong in south africa and I only started thinking about these things in grade 6 and that's when I started setting goals for my self that lead me to where I am right know.</p>
